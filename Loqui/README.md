LOQUI Instant Messenger
=====
LOQUI Instant Messenger is a mobile chat app for Firefox OS that allows you to have all your chat accounts
in just one FirefoxOS app. https://loqui.im

Providers support
===
At the moment it supports accounts from:
 * Google Hangouts
 * Facebook Chat
 * Nimbuzz
 * Nokia ovi
 * Microsoft Lync
 * Any other XMPP/Jabber provider in the world

How does it work? (It does!)
====
It uses a great javascript library for performing XMPP communication which is called "Strophe.js".
Strophe is capable of connecting to any XMPP server listening trough BOSH (Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP).

We may change soon the connection protocol for WebSockets + SimplePUSH in order to save battery when multiple accounts are set up.

In longer term, connections should be made through javascript TCPSockets API, avoiding the need for BOSH or WebSockets servers and thus improving performance and reliability.
